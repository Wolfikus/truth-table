# Truth Table

## Description

The gem of truth

## Summary

Generate a truth table for a logical expression

## Usage

To use, pass a logical expression consiting of varibale names and logical operators.

    $ irb -r 'truth-table'
    > tt = TruthTable.new("(a && b) || c")
    > puts tt.table_string
     a | b | c | (a && b) || c 
	---┼---┼---┼---------------
 	 T | T | T |      T 
 	 T | T | F |      T 
 	 T | F | T |      T 
 	 T | F | F |      F 
	 F | T | T |      T 
	 F | T | F |      F 
	 F | F | T |      T 
	 F | F | F |      F 

Variable names must begin with a lower case letter and be alphanumeric with underscores.

Accepted operators:

* and
* or
* &&
* ||
* !
* not
* ^
* xor (gets converted to ^)

## Usage with 'mathn' package

M = Matrix[*TruthTable.new("(a && b) || c").rows]
V = Vector[*TruthTable.new("(a && b) || c").result]

In this example M stays for Matrix, that consists of Truth Table rows and V - for Vector, based on Truth Table result.
